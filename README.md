# Yapoli-test
Front-end ReactJS test developed for [Yapoli](https://yapoli.com/pt/).
## About
The application consists of two screens: one being a sign-in page that accepts a set of stated email and password in order to access the second interface, that contains a list of images, their names and upload date. Once the list is fetched from the api, it is kept in the LocalStorage, and it is only called again in case one (or more) of the list items get *deleted* and the user hits the *Retrieve all images* button.
